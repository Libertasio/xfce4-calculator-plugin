TODO before 1.0
===============

- More configurability:
        - Let the user choose between radians and degrees for trigonometric
          functions
        - Let the user choose history length
        - Let the user choose number of significant digits in output

- Check portability:
        - sqrt(-1), x/0.0 etc. -->  crash, or NaN/Inf?
        - Are functions like log2 and cbrt available everywhere, etc.?

- Take a look at the localisation/translation stuff.

- Add support for multi argument functions
        - Then add support for pow(x,y) and atan2(x,y)


Beyond 1.0:
===========

- Better precision (e.g. using mpfr)

- More functions? (Hyperbolics? Gamma?)
        - "R^n â†’ R" functions are easy to add, as long as they are implemented
          in the C math library.
